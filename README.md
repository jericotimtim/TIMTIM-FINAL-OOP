## OOP Principles
The project incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity, reusability, and clear structure.

1. **Encapsulation**  
   - Store user details (e.g., age, weight, dietary restrictions) and meal data as private fields with public methods for access and modification.  

2. **Inheritance**  
   - A Meal parent class with subclasses like Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.  

3. **Polymorphism**  
   - Override a suggestMeal method to provide unique meal options for each subclass..  

4. **Abstraction**  
   -Use an interface MealPlanner with methods like generatePlan(), viewMeals(), and trackNutrients().
